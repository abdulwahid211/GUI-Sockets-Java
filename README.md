# Sockets-Java-GUI
An internet chat room application built using Sockets and Swing in Java.   

It uses a Server which enables multiple clients to communicate and interact with each other. 

The Server application can handle multiple client requests by the use of multithreading. 

Clients can broadcast messages with each other, and specifically interact with fellow client application.

# Usage

Both client and Server Jar files will be found in `out/artifacts` from this repo. 

In order to run the whole internet chart room scenario, you must first run the Server Jar File by entering `java -cp Server.jar Server` and then set up the port number you want the server to listen. 

Finally to run the client application, enter  `java -cp Client.jar Client` in a separate terminal.

Please note the clients port numbers should be same for Server application. 

By default, all port number and host for client and server are set to `5000` and `localhost`.
